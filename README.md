# My study projects

This repository contains a collection of learning projects completed as part of Data Science course. I completed the Yandex Practicum Data Science course (certificate attached) where I developed these projects as part of my learning journey. Each project represents a practical task aimed at developing key skills in data analysis, machine learning, and working with large datasets.

| Name | Description | Tools |
| :--------: | :-------: | :-------: |
|[Toxic Comment Recognition](https://github.com/masha-ds/yp-projects/tree/main/toxic_comment_recognition) | I trained a model for classifying the toxicity of comments. This allows for the automation and acceleration of moderation.|nltk, tqdm, TfidfVectorizer, LogisticRegression, ComplementNB, LGBMClassifier|
|[Customer Age Estimation](https://github.com/masha-ds/yp-projects/tree/main/cv_customer_age_recognition) |I developed a model to determine customers' age from photos, enabling targeted product recommendations and ensuring compliance in alcohol sales.|keras, CV|
|[Optimizing Oil Well Drilling: Profit and Risk Analysis Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/masha-ds/yp-projects/tree/main/best_location_for_drilling) |I built a model to identify the region with maximum profit and analyzed it along with the associated risks using the Bootstrap technique.|Bootstrap, Pipeline, ColumnTransformer, LinearRegression, Lasso, Ridge, Scalers, GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV|
|[Taxi Orders Forecasting](https://github.com/masha-ds/yp-projects/tree/main/time_series_taxi_ordering) |I developed a model that effectively predicts taxi orders by leveraging time-based features and lag variables, achieving a strong performance.|decompose, LGBMRegressor, CatBoostRegressor, LinearRegression, ElasticNet, FunctionTransformer|
|[Predicting Employee Satisfaction and Attrition](https://github.com/masha-ds/yp-projects/tree/main/hr-project)| I predicted employee job satisfaction levels and instances of turnover based on the available data|Pipeline, ColumnTransformer, Encoders, Scalers, GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, LinearRegression, LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, DecisionTreeRegressor, SVC|
|[Optimizing Steel Production: Temperature Prediction and Process Stability Enhancement](https://github.com/masha-ds/yp-projects/tree/main/steel_prod_temp_prediction) |To optimize the production process and reduce energy consumption, the best model for predicting alloy temperature was selected.|GridSearchCV, PolynomialFeatures, LinearRegression, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, CatBoostRegressor, LGBMRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, SHAP|

# Optimizing Oil Well Drilling: Profit and Risk Analysis Using Machine Learning
----
## Description

We need to decide where to drill a new oil well. We have been provided with oil samples from three regions: each containing 10,000 oil fields, where the quality of the oil and the volume of reserves were measured. We will build a machine learning model to help determine the region where extraction will yield the highest profit. We will analyze potential profit and risks using the Bootstrap technique.

## Tools and skills

_Bootstrap, pipeline, ColumnTransformer, LinearRegression, Lasso, Ridge, Scalers, GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV_

## Steps

1. Data Loading and Preparation.

2. Training and Evaluating Models for Each Region.

3. Preparing for Profit Calculation.

4. Calculating Risks and Profits for Each Region.

## Results

During the development of linear regression models, we determined that only one feature influences the predictions, which may indicate that the other features do not contain useful information for predicting oil reserves. To improve the model's performance, it may be necessary to conduct a deeper analysis of the feature space and consider adding additional features or applying feature transformations.

The high accuracy of the model for the second region provided the greatest confidence in minimizing the risk of losses in this region.

When preparing the profit calculation, we assessed the minimum level of reserves required for break-even drilling in each region and the average volume of reserves needed for break-even drilling of a single well. The results of the bootstrap analysis showed that the second region is the least risky investment. However, if the prediction quality for the first region can be improved to minimize the risk of unprofitable drilling, it could become more attractive due to its higher profitability.
